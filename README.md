# public_puzzle_design

This repo is more of a dumping ground for some design notes than an actual project, but hopefully the notes can prove useful to somebody.

In particular, basic details are provided to design your own ['toru' puzzle](http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=1685) as well as some ideas for exapnding on the basic platform.

Enjoy!
